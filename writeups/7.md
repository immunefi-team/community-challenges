**RareNFT** is an ERC721 NFT minter contract where users are allowed to mint the tokenId along with random **drawNum** argument, and if they are lucky enough to match the luckyNum with **_luckyVal**(set randomly by the contract constructor) then it is considered to be as **Rare** NFT which is different from existing other non-rare tokenId's as contract additional transfers the extra **0.1** ether for the rare NFT holder on **collect()** function.

The practise of generating pseudo-random numbers using block properties is highly discouraged as relying on the following onchain variables for producing random numbers are predictable.

```solidity
        bytes32 randHash = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                blockhash(block.number - 1),
                block.timestamp,
                block.coinbase,
                gasleft(),
                tx.gasprice,
                tx.origin,
                nonce,
                msg.sender
            )
        );
```

The variables used for the randomness are:

```
blockhash(block.number - 1): hash of the previous block
block.number: current block number
block.coinbase: current block miner's address
block.timestamp: current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
gasleft(): the amount of gas left consumed by the tx.
tx.gasprice: gas price for the transaction to process.
nonce: RareNFT contract appends nonce for each NFT mint.
msg.sender: address of the function caller.
```

Example, use of block.timestamp is insecure, as a miner can choose to provide any timestamp within a few seconds and still get his block accepted by others. Use of blockhash, block.difficulty and other fields is also insecure, as they're controlled by the miner.

In order for the exploitation, The attacker must know the **luckyVal** set by the contract constructor upon deployment, Since the **luckyVal** is a **private** variable. We need to read the storage slot to get the private value set by the contract.

```
let luckyVal = await ethers.provider.getStorageAt(rare.address, 4); // 4 is the "slot"
console.log(luckyVal);
```

Whitehat @zpano wrote a proof of concept contract [RareNFTAttack](https://github.com/immunefi-team/community-challenges/blob/master/contracts/malicious/RareNFTAttack.sol) to demonstrate how an attacker would always make sure to generate a rare tokenId.

Creating a strong enough source of randomness in Ethereum is very challenging. Several workarounds have been developed that overcome this limitations in one way or the other, such as

* Using commit-reveal strategy e.g. RANDAO.
* Using external sources of randomness via oracles eg: Chainlink VRF
